# 1983 to 2017 Video Game Sales Interactive Visualizations

#### **Our goal**

The game industry has been booming in recent years. Video games are very popular among young people and player counts have hit 30 billion and will continue to grow. Our group members are fans of video games as well. Besides playing games, we found video games led to the development of other industries, such as the live streaming industry. Those factors may indicate that many people will be willing to invest and profit from the game market. For those potential investors and game lovers, we decided to build an interactive visualization system for them to access the latest information and 40-year sales trend of video games, and help stakeholders find potential market opportunities.  
Users need to understand the market and make the right investments to profit from it. Their main concern is about sales. Thus, our interactive visualizations can provide answers to analytical questions about video game sales over the last forty years from common factors including publishers, genres, regions, etc.

#### Input data

The dataset is from Kaggle and contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies from 1983 to 2017. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. In this data set, there are more than 15,000 records.

Data Fields include:

*   Rank — Ranking of overall sales
*   Name — The games name
*   Platform — Platform of the game’s release (i.e. PC, PS4, etc.)
*   Year — Year of the game’s release
*   Genre — Genre of the game
*   Publisher — Publisher of the game
*   NA\_Sales — Sales in North America (in millions)
*   EU\_Sales — Sales in Europe (in millions)
*   JP\_Sales — Sales in Japan (in millions)
*   Other\_Sales — Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
*   Global\_Sales — Total worldwide sales

#### Intended visualization design

Our initial design was to perform three interactive visualizations presented to the user, including a race bar chart, a line graph, and a sorted bar chart on the home page.

*   The bar chart race would be an animation visualization to show the variation of game publishers’ ranking with their global sales year by year. Users can intuitively observe the flourishing of video games, and the rise or fall of different game publishers in these decades.
*   The line chart would show year versus global sales. Users can check the overall global sales trend in years. Also, there will be a range selection bar for users to set their target years range.
*   The sorted bar chart would show the top-10 video games by geographical metrics. Users can filter the current graph through the drop-down menu above the bar chart to explore possible game sales ranking changes between different regions.

Additionally, we intend to add icon buttons on the homepage which show the logo of the most popular video game platforms. After clicking on each button, the page would jump into a new page which will show the most recent top games on that platform. Users can then browse the descriptions, sales, and pictures of related most popular games.

#### Data clean and manipulation

Our group used Python Pandas, Excel, and R to clean up about 300 missing data that lacked important information, such as year, platform, global sales, etc. Our group then used the cleaned data to create three new derived datasets to meet the different requirements in our various charts. In the bar chart race, we kept ‘Rank,’ ‘Publisher,’ ‘Year,’ and ‘Global Sale’. And we grouped them by the ‘Year’ and ‘Publisher’. This dataset can be utilized to show the total global sales of different game publishers each year. For the sales line chart by year in different regions, we kept ‘Year’, ‘Global Sales,’ and corresponding sales in different regions. This dataset can show annual sales in different regions, and the resulted chart can show the trend of games sales in 40 years among different regions. In the sales bar chart by genre, the dataset kept ‘Global Sales’, ‘Year’, and ‘Genre.’ We summed up all the sales in a year by different genres and counted the number of games under each genre in a year.

#### Design improvements

After cleaning and manipulating the data, we made improvements to the original system design to make the project more implementable. The first chart is still a bar chart race to show users the rise and fall of game publishers over the past 40 years. We changed the previous line chart to years (x-axis) vs. sales in different regions (y-axis). Users can select the region from the drop-down list to check how sales have changed by region over 40 years. For the sorted bar chart, we changed the previous design to show the number of games under each genre per year. Users can know from this chart what are the most released game genres for each year.

#### Final prototype

Our final prototype meets the most requirements of our first design, which includes three interactive visualizations (Bar Chart Race, Line Chart, Sorted Bar Chart) and one section for hyperlinks to acquire more information. However, it still looks a little bit different. In addition to the adjustment of visual charts, we initially planned to make each section displayed two by two symmetrically on the homepage. The bar chart race is much longer than we thought, so we make it occupy the whole first row. The two remaining interactive visualizations are arranged symmetrically after the bar chart race.

The first visualization is the bar chart race. This chart is an animation about the relationship between global sales and game publishers. A high-volume publisher will appear at the top with a longer bar, and the poor one will appear at the bottom with a shorter bar. As time advances, the ranking changes between game publishers and their bar length.

The next visualization is a line chart and it is about sales versus years in different regions. There is a drop-down list at the top left corner which includes global sales, Europe sales, North America sales, Japan sales, and other sales. Users could select a specific region and see the game sales trend over 40 years.

The third visualization is about the number of releases per game genre for each year and the corresponding global sales amount. The height of each bar represents the number of game releases under this genre. We also sorted the bar chart descendingly by the count of games. Additionally, The color of the bars represents the global sales amount. A large number of releases does not guarantee high sales amount in this genre. There is a color legend on the right side. The color close to red means higher sales, close to green means lower, and close to yellow means near to the average. The default setting of this chart is to show all years. And users can filter year by clicking on the “left” or “right” arrow or dragging the scroll on the top right. The chart will then automatically change to show the corresponding information at the input year. When the user’s mouse hovers on a bar, a tooltip window will be displayed including the genre name, the count of games, and the global sales in millions.

The final part is the button section. There are four buttons in this zone. They connect to the top-selling games page of four well-known platforms including PC, Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation. Users can use it for future investigation.

For the overall design of the web page, except for the bar chart race, the rest of the diagrams can be automatically adaptive according to any browser and device.

#### Analysis Examples

Game investors can use our sorted bar chart to analyze the hottest game genres developed in recent years and their corresponding sales. Through these analyses, they can filter out the appropriate game investment projects and maxiumu the profit.

Game stakeholders can use our interactive visualization to conduct a retrospective analysis of the game’s development over the last 40 years. Through the analysis, they can summarize the trends and characteristics of the game development and make a predictive assessment of the subsequent game market.

#### Discussions

Overall our project is progressing very nicely. We had a good division of labor and everyone did their assigned tasks well. The biggest takeaway from this project was the realization that there is probably a huge gap between the design and the final prototype. For example, initially in bar chart race part, we wanted to show the top 10 sales game publishers changes from 1983 to 2017, but after processing the data, we found that in the early stage, it may be due to the overall development environment and Internet development plus the relatively low penetration rate of video games. This led to the appearance of many blank bars, so for the sake of aesthetics and visual experience, we finally chose the data from 1985 to 2016. Besides, In the initial design, we can come up with many extraordinary ideas but in the implementation of the prototype we have to abandon many design ideas and make compromises on the final product. At first we planned to use d3 libarary for all our interactive visualizations. But it took more time than we expected to build all the charts using d3 libarary. Therefore, we changed our initial design and used Tableau to implement sorted bar chart in final result after realizing the time constraints of the project. The rest of the visualizations are still implemented using d3.

#### Ethical and Societal Considerations

In general, our project does not violate any ethical guidelines. Our data comes from Kaggle which is a free platform for users to access public data sets. However, it is worth noting that this data has significant missing values from 2017 onwards and this has led us to discard this part of the data. Similarly, we found that the peak of game sales was around 2010 and the data showed a sharp decline after that. We can see that this does not correspond to the real market trends. We suspect that due to the prevalence of digital versions of video games, this has led to some barriers to data collection. More and more game platforms and publishers will consider the privacy of the data and will not disclose the real data. In addition to this, again due to the privacy of the data. We did not find a suitable API to display game description and pictures. It is also possible to spend money to buy data illegally obtained by others, but this is not a good manner, and we have to respect the request of websites that do not want data leakage.
